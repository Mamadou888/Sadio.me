        Hi, my name is <a> Mamadou Sadio Diallo</a>. 
        <br>
        I care about solving problems and making peoples lives better. 
        <br>
        I am also a hackathon guru, passionate about the maker culture.
        <br>
        I aspire to help people, alleviating poverty and social injustice everywhere. 
      </p>

      <p>
      I enjoy being active, as long as its pick-up basketball games. 
      <br>
      When I'm bored, I procrastinate on Youtube and freestyle, rap-battling, with friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to empower young people with technology. 
        <br>
        I currently do this at <a href="http://younghackers.us">The Young Hackers</a>. 
        <br>
        I also teach engineering concepts at <a href="http://maker-state.com">Makerstate</a> and organize workshops with <a href="http://younginnovators.nyc/">Global Kids</a>.
